# Credit Risk Analysis

## Problem statement:

To conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and deep analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing basic customer details and extensive credit-related information. The aim is to create new, informative features, calculate a hypothetical credit score, and uncover meaningful patterns, anomalies, and insights within the data.

## Data Dictionary:

The data dictionary is available here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZuK6o1MXFLmnhkFuDEedasDfVqu9ISPV/edit#gid=688359417

## Expectations:

The project expects a deep dive into bank details and credit data, creating valuable features, a hypothetical credit score, and uncovering hidden patterns. This involves thorough EDA, strategic feature engineering, model-driven score calculation, and insightful analysis that reveals factors influencing creditworthiness and guides potential risk mitigation strategies.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

To perform a comprehensive EDA to understand the data's structure, characteristics, distributions, and relationships.
Identify and address any missing values, mismatch data types, inconsistencies, or outliers.
Utilize appropriate visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots, correlation matrices) to uncover patterns and insights.

## Feature Engineering:

To create new features that can be leveraged for the calculation of credit scores based on domain knowledge and insights from EDA.
Aggregate the data on the customer level if required.

## Hypothetical Credit Score Calculation:

To develop a methodology to calculate a hypothetical credit score using relevant features.
Clearly outline the developed methodology in the notebook, providing a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind it. (use inspiration from FICO scores and try to use relevant features you created)
Explore various weighting schemes to assign scores.
Provide a score for each individual customer

## Analysis and Insights

Added valuable insights from EDA and credit score calculation
